Description:
Every feature is fully implemented except the mouse to world coordinates conversion is buggy.
We're pretty sure the source of the error is somewhere in the eye ray, but we can't figure out where.
However, the highlighted bone is selected properly, and can be rotated and everything else works

Disclaimers:
(See above description)
